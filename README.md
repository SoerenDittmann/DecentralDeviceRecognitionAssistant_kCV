# DecentralDeviceRecognitionAssistant_kCV
Nested cross validation to determine and repeated cross validation to evaluate the final model of the decentral device recognition assistant. 

To replicate the results of the nested cross validation determining the best model and the evaluation of the best model, please set up the described anaconda environments. 
To reproduce the results from scratch, the OS .spydata file "sensor_dic_final_final.spydata" is required. To limit required GitHub space, this file is not uploaded. The file can be provided.
An alternative approach is to load the final spydata dataframes in the directories of this repository. They also contain the required open source data.

The following processor was used to run the code in this repository: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8650U CPU @ 1.90GHz   2.11 GHz with 32 GB RAM.
