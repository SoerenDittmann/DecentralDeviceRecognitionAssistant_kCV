To run the code of the repeated cross validation with the best model previously defined via a nested cross validation please:

1. Set up a new anaconda environment with the mentioned packages and versions in the text file best_model_env
2. Start Spyder from the anaconda terminal with the above defined environment
3. Download the Classification directory with helper functions
4. Set the Spyder path to the path with the Classification env (this is necessary for helper functions)
5. Verify under Tools, preferences, Python interpreter the correct path to the anaconda env or update path
6. Run 1. cell to load all packages

---- If you want to run the code on your own from scratch
6a. Import sensor_dic_final_final.spydata file into Spyder and run code beginning from 2. cell

---- If you want to import the final data 
6b. Run cells defining the class HC2withReject(HIVECOTEV2) and def custom_precision (y_true, y_pred, threshold=0.2)
7b. Import best_model_data.spydata
